# FacesOfUWP
A simple .NET Core 3.0 &amp; Windows Forms app that demonstrates UWP facial recognition APIs, this is a copy of the final code built in the blog post I wrote about this: https://robertwray.co.uk/blog/facial-recognition-using-the-uwp-apis-in-windows-10-via-windows-forms-on-net-core-3-0

This little app uses:

* .NET Core 3.0 (preview 5)
* Windows Forms on .NET Core (with a work-around to be able to use the Windows Forms designer in Visual Studio)
* The Microsoft.Windows.SDK.Contracts NuGet package to provide access to UWP APIs on Windows 10
* The Windows 10 UWP Facial Recognition APIs
